Objective: Redesign and rebuild all guest pages end-to-end so they are visually premium, consistent, responsive, and production-ready while preserving existing core functionality and flows. After UI architecture is complete, wire all pages to existing APIs without breaking behavior. Core constraints: 1) Keep all existing business logic and flows intact unless explicitly improved. 2) Use a strict design system with realtor brand adaptation. 3) Build for desktop, tablet, and mobile from the start (not as an afterthought). 4) Do not introduce random colors, random spacing, or inconsistent components. 5) Prioritize accessibility, performance, and maintainability. 6) Keep implementation compatible with current project stack (Next.js app router + Tailwind + existing UI components/hooks/services). Brand adaptation requirements: - Inputs: - brandColor (primary) - secondaryColor - accentColor - realtorName, logo, tagline - Create a robust tokenized system from these values: - Primary actions (buttons, active states, highlights) - Secondary accents (icons, borders, badges) - Neutral surfaces (cards, backgrounds, text hierarchy) - Add safe contrast handling: - Auto-adjust text/icon color if brand color contrast fails WCAG AA. - Ensure brand consistency across all states: - default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading, error, success. Responsive requirements: - Mobile-first layout. - Breakpoints: mobile, tablet, desktop. - Each page must define: - Layout grid behavior per breakpoint - Typography scale per breakpoint - Spacing scale per breakpoint - Component collapse/stack behavior - Touch target sizes and sticky/fixed elements where needed - No horizontal overflow on any screen size. - Preserve fast perceived performance on low-end devices. Pages to redesign and rebuild (in this exact order): 1) Guest Landing (/guest-landing) 2) Guest Root Redirect/Entry (/guest-landing) 3) Browse (/guest/browse) 4) Login (/guest/login) 5) Register (/guest/register) 6) Profile (/guest/profile) 7) Notifications (/guest/notifications) 8) Messages (/guest/messages) 9) Bookings List (/guest/bookings) 10) Booking Details (/guest/bookings/[id]) 11) Booking Checkout (/guest/bookings/[id]/checkout) 12) Booking Review (/guest/bookings/[id]/review) 13) Favorites (/guest/favorites) 14) History (/guest/history) 15) Help (/guest/help) 16) Preview Realtor Storefront (/guest/preview/[realtorId]) Critical functional requirements to preserve/improve: - Authentication guards and redirects. - Booking lifecycle: pending, active, cancelled, completed, dispute states. - Messaging: - conversation list + thread - direct guest↔realtor chat - booking/property context chat - voice note playback inline - file attachments - unread counts and read states - Booking details: - status badges, payment summary, receipt actions, host contact, review CTA, cancellation flow. - Dispute flow: - create dispute, view thread, respond, state transitions. - Notifications and history behavior. - Favorites and browse interactions. - Error/empty/loading/skeleton states on every page. - Consistent toasts and feedback UX. Design quality requirements: - “Premium but clean” look: strong hierarchy, generous whitespace, consistent card system. - Use one coherent visual language across all guest pages. - Avoid dark-mode artifacts unless dark mode is intentionally supported. - Preserve trust cues for payment/security-sensitive flows. - Make dense pages readable with clear information grouping. API integration phase (after UI refactor): - Wire every page to existing service layer/APIs. - Keep API contracts intact; do not break backend expectations. - Add resilient loading and retry patterns where appropriate. - Gracefully handle API failures and authorization errors. - Ensure optimistic updates only where safe. - Validate all query/mutation invalidation logic. - Keep telemetry/logging hooks where useful for debugging. Output format I want from you: Phase 1: Design system + page-by-page UI architecture plan (desktop/tablet/mobile). Phase 2: Implement pages one-by-one in listed order. Phase 3: API wiring and state management hardening. Phase 4: QA checklist and final consistency sweep. For each page deliver: - UX decisions - Layout behavior by breakpoint - Components used/reused - States handled (loading/empty/error/success) - API data dependencies - Acceptance criteria Non-negotiables: - Do not remove core functionality. - Do not ship inconsistent styles. - Do not leave any page partially responsive. - Do not hardcode theme values outside the token system. - Keep code modular and reusable.
